<b>So... What is this?</b>

	This is Lollipop masters, where we can keep score and compete on who is the best at the Lollipop (and Marshmallow) hidden minigame.


<b>What minigame?</b>

	<a href="http://blog.en.uptodown.com/find-mini-game-hidden-android-5-0-lollipop/">This</a> might be useful...

<b>Cool, how can I join in?</b>

	This is tied to TJHSST's intranet, Ion, so you must be a student or staff at TJ to participate.

<b>I was looking at the source, and it looks pretty crappy...</b>

	First of all, that's not a question. However, I digress, because none of these questions are frequently asked anyway. The website was pretty poorly and hastily written. I'll try to fix some things up and make thins less hacky, but in the mean time, please be nice and don't actively try to break things... thanks!
